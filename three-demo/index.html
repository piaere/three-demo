          This will mark the end of proof-of-work for Ethereum, and the full
          transition to proof-of-stake.
        </p>

        <p>
          This sets the stage for future scaling upgrades including sharding.
        </p>

        <p>The Merge will reduce Ethereum's energy consumption by ~99.95%.</p>

        <h1>~Q3/Q4 2022</h1>
        <h3>
          The Merge is the most significant upgrade in the history of Ethereum.
          Extensive testing and bug bounties were undertaken to ensure a safe
          transition to proof-of-stake.
        </h3>

        <p>
          This process is in its final stages, with plans to undergo The Merge
          on a few public testnets before finally moving forward with Mainnet.

        <h2>What is The Merge?</h2>

        <p>
          The Merge represents the joining of the existing execution layer of
          Ethereum (the Mainnet we use today) with its new proof-of-stake
          consensus layer, the Beacon Chain. It eliminates the need for
          energy-intensive mining and instead secures the network using staked
          ETH. A truly exciting step in realizing the Ethereum vision – more
          scalability, security, and sustainability.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's important to remember that initially, the Beacon Chain shipped
          separately from Mainnet. Ethereum Mainnet - with all it's accounts,
          balances, smart contracts, and blockchain state - continues to be
          secured by proof-of-work, even while the Beacon Chain runs in parallel
          using proof-of-stake. The approaching Merge is when these two systems
          finally come together, and proof-of-work is replaced permanently by
          proof-of-stake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's consider an analogy. Imagine Ethereum is a spaceship that isn't
          quite ready for an interstellar voyage. With the Beacon Chain, the
          community has built a new engine and a hardened hull. After
          significant testing, it's almost time to hot-swap the new engine for
          the old mid-flight. This will merge the new, more efficient engine
          into the existing ship, ready to put in some serious lightyears and
          take on the universe.
        </p>

        <h2>Merging with Mainnet</h2>

        <p>
          Since genesis, proof-of-work has secured Mainnet. This is the Ethereum
          blockchain we're all used to—it contains every transaction, smart
          contract, and balance since it began in July 2015.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout Ethereum's history, developers have been hard at work
          preparing for an eventual transition away from proof-of-work to
          proof-of-stake. On December 1, 2020, the Beacon Chain was created,
          which has since existed as a separate blockchain to Mainnet, running
          in parallel.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Beacon Chain has not been processing Mainnet transactions.
          Instead, it has been reaching consensus on its own state by agreeing
          on active validators and their account balances. After extensive
          testing, the Beacon Chain's time to reach consensus on more is rapidly
          approaching. After The Merge, the Beacon Chain will be the consensus
          engine for all network data, including execution layer transactions
          and account balances.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Merge represents the official switch to using the Beacon Chain as
          the engine of block production. Mining will no longer be the means of
          producing valid blocks. Instead, the proof-of-stake validators assume
          this role and will be responsible for processing the validity of all
          transactions and proposing blocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          No history is lost. As Mainnet gets merged with the Beacon Chain, it
          will also merge the entire transactional history of Ethereum. You
          don't need to do anything. Your funds are safe.
